    // This rule is aimed at ensuring all return statements either specify a
    // value or don't specify a value. Since JavaScript offers no typing
    // it is impossible to check a function actually returns what it intends to.
    // This is a helping hand in the right direction.

    'consistent-return': 2,

    // It is considered by many to be best practice to never omit curly braces
    // around blocks, even when they are optional, because it can lead to bugs
    // and reduces code clarity.

    // If you have a switch block you should always cover all possible cases.

    // Comparing to null without a type-checking operator (== or !=), can have

    // The switch statement in JavaScript is one of the more error-prone

    // Writing functions within loops tends to result in errors due to the way

    // 'Magic numbers' are numbers that occur multiple time in code without an

    // Don't use `new` for side-effects. Since `new` always creates an object

    // http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-new
    'no-new': 2,

    // It's possible to create functions in JavaScript using the Function

    // There are three primitive types in JavaScript that have wrapper objects:
    // string, number, and boolean. Although possible, there aren't any good

    // The leading zero to identify an octal literal has been a source of

    // Assignment to variables declared as function parameters can be misleading
    // and lead to confusing behavior, as modifying function parameters will
    // also mutate the arguments object. Often, assignment to function

    // The `__proto__` property has been deprecated as of ECMAScript 3.1 and

    // In JavaScript, it's possible to redeclare the same variable name using

    // Having an assignment expression in a `return` statement results in

    // The comma operator includes multiple expressions where only one is
